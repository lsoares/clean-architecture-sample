# User CRUD Sample App
User CRUD sample app to demonstrate a 
[domain-driven architecture](https://medium.com/codex/clean-architecture-for-dummies-df6561d42c94)
in Kotlin.

## Goals
I created this repo for multiple reasons:
- Have a sample project that anyone can use as a starting point or as a reference
- Practice and consolidate the clean architecture concepts (and other principles stated below)
- Have an example project with standard terminology to make teaching easier
- Fun

## Principles
- no frameworks
- minimalist approach
- simple crud: create, delete, and list user with API; can't create twice
- follow ports & adapters architecture
- feature driven - web handlers and domain features are split by files 
- with integration tests
- applied TDD
