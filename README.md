# User CRUD Sample App
User CRUD sample app to demonstrate a 
[domain-driven architecture](https://medium.com/codex/clean-architecture-for-dummies-df6561d42c94)
in Kotlin.


## Goals
I created this repo for multiple reasons:
- Have a sample project that anyone can use as a starting point or as a reference
- Practice and consolidate the clean architecture concepts (and other principles stated below)
- Have an example project with standard terminology to make teaching easier
- Fun

## Goals
- no frameworks
- can create and list user with API
- follows ports&adapters architecture
- has integration tests
- applied TDD
